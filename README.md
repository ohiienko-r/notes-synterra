# Synterra Notes

This is a test task for Synterra.

A simple Notes App (yep, just notes app).

## Tech stack

- Next JS
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- RxDB

## Installation

While this app is deplyed on **`Vercel`** [here](https://notes-synterra.vercel.app/),
you may want to install and test this app locally. 

### Here are the steps to install the app locally: 

Prerequisite: 
- Git
- Terminal (e.g. Windows Terminal or any available)
- Code editor (VS Code, Fleet, WebStorm etc.)

Steps to follow: 

1. Open a terminal in any suitable folder and run the following command: ```git clone https://github.com/ohiienko-r/notes-synterra.git```;
2. Wait till remote repository is cloned to your machine and then run ```cd ./notes-synterra```;
3. After navigating to the folder with the app, you will need to install all dependencies by running ```npm i``` in the same terminal;
4. Once all dependencies are installed you can open the project with any suitable or available `code editor`
5. To start an app simply run ```npm run dev``` in the terminal and open ```http://localhost:3000``` in the browser.

Thank you for taking your time.
Good luck!
